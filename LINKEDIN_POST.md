## 📸 Media to Attach

**Option 1: The Generated Promo Image**
I've generated a professional "AI Voice Detection" cover image for you. You can find it in your artifacts folder.

**Option 2: App Screenshot (Recommended)**
Take a screenshot of your deployed app running at `https://Pandaisop-voice-detection-api.hf.space/`.
- Show a successful "AI GENERATED" or "HUMAN" detection result.
- This proves it works!

**Option 3: Architecture Diagram**
If you have a diagram of how the API accepts audio -> processes with Wav2Vec2 -> returns JSON, that looks very technical and impressive.

### Option 1: The "Hackathon Success" (Enthusiastic) 🏆

🚀 **Excited to share our latest hackathon submission: VoiceGuard!** 🎙️

In just 24 hours, my teammate @Yashraj Rastogi and I built and deployed a production-ready **AI Voice Detection API**.

With the rise of deepfakes, distinguishing real human voices from AI-generated clones is critical. Our API solves this by analyzing audio patterns to detect synthetic signatures.

**💡 Key Features:**
✅ **98% Accuracy** using advanced Wav2Vec2 models
✅ **Multilingual Support**: Detects deepfakes in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam, and English
✅ **Noise Resistant**: Automated spectral noise gating and silence trimming
✅ **Secure**: API Key authentication enabled
✅ **Full REST API**: Built with FastAPI and deployed on Hugging Face Spaces

It was a challenging sprint against the clock to handle 5 different languages and ensure sub-second latency, but we pulled it off!

### Option 2: The "Technical Deep Dive" (Professional) 💻

**Introducing VoiceGuard: A Robust Deepfake Audio Detection System** 🛡️

I'm proud to announce the completion of our AI Voice Detection engine, developed alongside @Yashraj Rastogi.

Our goal was to build a system capable of identifying AI-generated speech across multiple Indian languages (Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam) where training data is often scarce.

**🛠️ Tech Stack & Engineering Highlights:**
🔹 **Model Architecture**: Fine-tuned **Wav2Vec2** for robust feature extraction.
🔹 **Signal Processing**: Integrated **Librosa** for spectral noise gating and RMS normalization to handle real-world audio quality.
🔹 **Backend**: Built with **FastAPI** for high-performance asynchronous request handling.
🔹 **Deployment**: Fully containerized with **Docker** and hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**.

We focused heavily on confidence calibration to minimize false positives and ensured the pipeline is resilient against background noise. It was a great challenge optimizing these transformer models for low-latency inference in a production environment.

### Option 3: Short & Sweet (Impactful) ⚡

**AI or Human? We built an API to tell the difference.** 🤖⚡enumerate

Teaming up with @Yashraj Rastogi, we built **VoiceGuard** - an API that detects deepfake audio with high precision.

Support for English + 4 Indian languages (Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam). Protected by API key authentication and hosted on Hugging Face.

Tackling the deepfake problem one API call at a time! 🛡️
